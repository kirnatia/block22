## Workshop Overview
Async/await is a way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript, built on top of promises.
The power of async/await lies in the fact that it makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

In this I learned:

1. How to use asynchronous JavaScript to interact with an API.
2. Manipulate and traverse the DOM to render data. 

API Endpoints
For this lab, I used API endpoints:

* Parties
* Guests
* RSVPs

## Project Requirements
# Instructions to get started and use the API.

* Clone this repoLinks to an external site.sitory to your local computer.
* Navigate into the project and open it in VScode.
* Launch the index.html file with Live Server.
* While page is not rendering properly. Find the missing functions.
* Once you have the functions working, you should see a list of parties, but the details button is broken. Write code in the script.js file to fix it.
* After the details button is working, you should see details of the party, but some values are returning undefined. Debug the problem.
* Finally, write code that enables the "delete" button.
* Now that the application is working as expected, add color, size, shape, and position to elements using CSS.
